Code and slides for the Remote Python Pizza session "I Can Show You That On A Map"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See "presentation/html/index.html" for slides including installation tips.


Update 2025
-----------
Installing now is a lot easier. I updated the code to work with current h3 syntax.

Requirements are now unfrozen, but there's a backup frozen file if you run into problems.

The code now works without special installation tricks on Python3.13 / Windows 10/11

Note: The slides have not been updated - use the notebook!
